# Dynamic Notify Function using `react-toastify`

This project introduces a reusable `notify` function that allows for displaying different types of toast notifications using `react-toastify`. The function dynamically adapts to various toast types (`success`, `error`, `info`, and `warning`), making it a flexible tool for showing notifications in your application.

## Installation

Before using the `notify` function, ensure that you have `react-toastify` installed in your project.

You can install it with:

```bash
npm install react-toastify
